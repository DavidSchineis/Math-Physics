        "This lab explores linear algebra in Python. We began by reviewing how Lists and NumPy arrays differ, focusing on how arrays allow algebraic operations. We then built and analyzed 2D and 3D arrays, studying their shapes, lengths, and slicing behavior. Moving into matrix algebra, we manually computed and verified matrix products, sums, and powers. Finally, we used matrix inversion to solve a system of linear equations, verifying our result by hand. This lab ties together array creation, matrix operations, and linear algebra using NumPy."
