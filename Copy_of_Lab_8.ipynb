        "This lab focused on exploring the properties of Pauli spin matrices using Python. We began by defining three Pauli spin matrices and verifying that they are both Hermitian and unitary through computation of their conjugate transposes, determinants, and inverses. Next, we examined their traces and the properties surrounding the Levi-Civita symbol. We then applied both cos, sin, and exp with their matrix counterparts cosm, sinm, and expm and built Taylor series expansions to approximate these functions and compared the results. Overall, this lab demonstrated how Pythons linear algebra tools can be used to analyze and verify complex matrices."
