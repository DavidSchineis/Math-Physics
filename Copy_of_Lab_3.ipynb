        "# Lab 3 Abstract:\n",
        "This lab explores the construction and visualization of 3D surfaces in Python using the Plotly library. We began by reviewing line plots in three dimensions, generating polygons and circles in different coordinate planes. We then introduced how to convert 1D vectors to 2D surface plots using mesh grids. We created spheres and cylinders by converting their respective coordinate systems to cartesian. We also did more complex parametrizations, like the seashell surface. Finally, we extended into animations by adding sliders to smoothly show shapes changing over time, first expanding a sphere in radius and then converting a sphere to an open cylinder. This lab highlights how Plotly, mesh grids, and slider tools in Python can be combined to explore geometry and visualize transformations in three dimensions.\n"
