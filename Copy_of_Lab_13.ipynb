        "This lab explores Fourier transforms and their applications to signals, images, and optics. We began by plotting 1D Fourier transforms of simple signals, and used FFT and IFFT to learn how frequency can be used to map back to the original function. We then moved on to 2D Fourier transforms to study point spread functions (PSFs) formed by different apertures. Circular and square apertures were compared to show how aperture size and shape directly effect the resolution and quality of real photos. Finally, we constructed a PSF using the real aperture mask of the James Webb Space Telescope and found the same PSF pattern seen in actual JWST images. This lab demonstrates how Fourier analysis is used in real world applications."
