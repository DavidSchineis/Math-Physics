        "#### This lab focuses on the fundamentals of Python, exploring basic commands such as if statements, for & while loops, as well as rudimentary 2D plotting commands. Using this syntax, it explores mathematical series, including the Taylor expansion of sin and ln functions. We find that adding more terms to the Taylor series brings the approximation closer to the actual function when x is small. For sin function, the approximation improves as more terms are included, even when x is large. However, for ln, the approximation works well within -1 < x < 1 but fails to match the actual function outside of this. This lab explores how Python can be used to visualize math concepts and understand the strengths and weaknesses of Taylor expansions.\n"

Must be careful with While loops, ensure that your While loop body contains an iteration that moves towards the conditional so you do not get stuck in a infinite loop.

        "* For both ln and sin, each increasing term makes it closer to the actual function at small |x|.\n",

        "* In terms of |x|, ln function diverges at higher values. For sin function, it is always converging no matter the size of |x|.\n",
