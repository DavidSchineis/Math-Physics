        "This lab explores using calculus tools in Python to analyze vector fields. We began by using np.gradient and np.trapezoid to approximate derivatives and integrals and compared them to pen-and-paper solutions. We then extended these methods to 3D fields, calculating gradients, divergence, and curl. We visualized gradients and divergence with quiver and colormesh plots, and then switched to Plotly to display vector fields, curls, and divergence in 3D. Throughout, we verified when values matched our by-hand calculations. This lab demonstrates how calculus and visualization tools can be combined to explore the structure and properties of vector fields in multiple dimensions."
