        "#### This lab initially covers different ways to iterate through For loops before introducing 3D visualizations using Eulers number and finally focusing on proving, approximating and visualizating a variety of complex numbers. This lab primarily looks at nth roots of complex numbers and verifying these roots through raising them back to original power, summing them to equal zero, or graphing them. Using 2D polar plots, we visualized the roots and verified that 2pi/n is the angle between all nth roots. We also created a n1 to n2 user-defined visualization with unique color and legend requirements. This was a good example of navigating a difficult space using different For loop techniques."
