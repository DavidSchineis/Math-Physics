        "This lab focuses on verifying the Divergence Theorem. We used ConvexHull to construct triangular meshes for different closed surfaces such as spheres, half-spheres, cylinders, cubes, and cones. We used meshgrid to create surface integrals of various vector fields. Then, we set up volume integrals by calculating divergence with np.gradient, masking out anything outside of our bounds. For each case, we compared the two inetegral results and confirmed that they matched closely with each other as well as with the by-hand value. This lab highlights how surface and volume integrals can be implemented in Python and how they can be used to confirm the Divergence Theorem across different shapes. Importantly, we also showed that the results follow the expected dependence on radius, height, or side length for each shape, and matched the by-hand calculations when at the given radius, height, or length."

However, setting up surface integrals from scratch is far from trivial, thus the code how to do so is provided to you below. This code can take an arbitrary array of triangles that define each small surface on a 3-d mesh, and finds the integral of a vector along the surface of this triangle."
